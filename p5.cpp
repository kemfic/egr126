    Program A.
      Develop a program containing 4 separate C++ functions to perform the following
      on a one-dimensional integer array LIST of dimension N:

        1. Determine (i.e. “return”) the highest value in LIST.
        2. Determine (i.e. “return”) the lowest value in LIST.
        3. Determine (i.e. “return”) the sum of all the items in LIST.
        4. Determine (i.e. “return”) the average of the values in LIST after 
           eliminating the lowest and the highest values. This function should
           invoke some or all of the other 3 functions.

   
    Program B.
      Develop a C++ program that will add the corresponding elements of two 
      2-dimensional arrays X and Y to produce the 2-dimensional array Z.  
      Arrays X, Y, Z have the same dimension [M] [N] (i.e. M rows and N columns).   

    NOTE: In the above programs, you will need to have the user input the dimensions of the respective arrays before execution of the functions.
