  Project 5, EGR-126

    Program B.
      Develop a C++ program that will add the corresponding elements of two 
      2-dimensional arrays X and Y to produce the 2-dimensional array Z.  
      Arrays X, Y, Z have the same dimension [M] [N] (i.e. M rows and N columns).   

    NOTE: In the above programs, you will need to have the user input the dimensions of the respective arrays before execution of the functions.
